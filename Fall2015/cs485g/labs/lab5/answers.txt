A. The fork() System Call
a)
 The parent ran first when we ran the program a.out.  
b)
Because the parent and the child are two different processes

c)
hello from child is printed out first 

d) Because the variable x exists in two diferent processes, changes in one process will not 
affect the value of the x in another


B. Multiple Fork Calls
2a) I think the output will be 
1
2
4
1
2
3
2
3
3


4a) No, i didn't predict it correctly

4b)I didn't consider that the if(fork() ==0) will run in the parent  


C. Starting Programs with exec
