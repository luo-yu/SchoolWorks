To run the program using Makefile, please use the following commands:

1. make clean

2. make SVM


My program read a binary file from the arg[1], which is passed by user 
as a parameter when he or she runs the program. 


When the program starts, it declares a unsigned int array of size 4096.

The program opens the file, and it reads the file 4 bytes at a time. 

The program switches opcode, and determins the operation. 

Once the operation is determined, the program read the next 12 bytes
and does the appropriate operations. 



My program assumes that the input file is in the correct format, that
is, each instruction is exactly 16 bytes long, and the first 4 bytes
will always be a constant

The program has the following jump instructions implemented: 
jgt
jlt
jeq
stop
